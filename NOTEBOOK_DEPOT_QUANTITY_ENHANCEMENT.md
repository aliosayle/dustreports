# Notebook Enhancement: Depot Quantity Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the enhancements made to `dataexploration.ipynb` to replace the "restock to 7 days" concept with "depot quantity" calculations.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Depot Quantity Functions
Added comprehensive depot quantity calculation functionality:
- `calculate_depot_quantity()` - Main function to calculate depot stock levels
- `get_depot_quantity_summary()` - Quick summary function
- Auto-detection of depot sites based on transaction volume and item diversity

### 2. Enhanced Stock Analysis
Updated the main `calculate_stock_and_sales()` function to:
- Include depot quantity as a standard column
- Replace theoretical "restock to 7 days" with actual depot inventory data
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Add new parameter `include_depot_qty` for flexibility

### 3. Documentation and Examples
Added comprehensive documentation including:
- SQL logic explanation for depot quantity calculation
- Step-by-step Python implementation details
- Business value and use case explanations
- Practical examples and demonstrations

## Technical Implementation

### Depot Quantity Calculation Logic
```sql
SELECT 
    ITEM,
    SUM(DEBITQTY) as TOTAL_IN,
    SUM(CREDITQTY) as TOTAL_OUT,
    SUM(DEBITQTY) - SUM(CREDITQTY) as DEPOT_QUANTITY
FROM ALLITEM 
WHERE SITE IN (depot_site_codes)
GROUP BY ITEM
ORDER BY DEPOT_QUANTITY DESC
```

### Auto-Detection of Depot Sites
The system automatically identifies depot sites by:
- Transaction volume (top 20% of sites by total DEBITQTY + CREDITQTY)
- Item diversity (top 30% of sites by number of unique items handled)
- Sites meeting either criteria are considered potential depots

### Integration with Existing Analytics
- Depot quantity is calculated for all items in the analysis
- Merged into the main result DataFrame on ITEM code
- Positioned prominently in column order after CURRENT_STOCK
- Handles missing data gracefully (defaults to 0)

## New Notebook Cells Added

1. **Cell c033f935**: Depot quantity calculation functions
2. **Cell 877fb653**: Demonstration and step-by-step explanation
3. **Cell 431c9299**: Summary and transition documentation
4. **Updated edf8dd55**: Enhanced main stock calculation function

## Benefits Over "Restock to 7 Days"

### Business Benefits
- **Real Data**: Based on actual inventory at depot locations
- **Actionable Insights**: Shows what's immediately available for redistribution
- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Enables better transfer planning
- **Inventory Visibility**: Clear view of central stock positions

### Technical Benefits
- **Data-Driven**: Uses actual transaction data vs theoretical calculations
- **Flexible**: Auto-detects depots or allows manual specification
- **Integrated**: Seamlessly works with existing analytics
- **Scalable**: Handles any number of depot sites

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# All items with depot quantities
result = calculate_stock_and_sales()

# Specific item analysis
result = calculate_stock_and_sales('F001')

# Quick summary with top results
get_stock_and_sales_summary('F001')
```

### Depot-Specific Analysis
```python
# Manual depot specification
depot_qty = calculate_depot_quantity(depot_sites=['14L', '15M'])

# Auto-detection with details
depot_qty = calculate_depot_quantity(show_details=True)
```

## Column Changes
- **Removed**: Theoretical "restock to 7 days" calculations
- **Added**: `DEPOT_QUANTITY` - actual stock at depot sites
- **Enhanced**: Better column ordering and documentation

## Next Steps
1. Test with live database connection
2. Update web application to use depot quantity
3. Train users on new depot quantity insights
4. Consider adding depot-to-site transfer recommendations

## Files Modified
- `dataexploration.ipynb` - Enhanced with depot quantity functionality
- This documentation file created for reference

## Compatibility
- All existing function calls continue to work
- New functionality is opt-in via parameters
- Legacy functions maintained for backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing workflows
