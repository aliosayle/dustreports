# Export Filter Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the export functionality in the DustReports application to include filter information in exported file titles and headers across all export formats (Excel, CSV, PDF).

## Changes Made

### 1. **Custom Reports Export Enhancement**

#### Frontend Changes (`templates/custom_reports.html`)
- Modified `exportReport()` function to collect current filter information
- Added collection of calculated fields information  
- Updated export data payload to include:
  - `filters`: Array of current filter conditions
  - `calculated_fields`: Array of current calculated field definitions

#### Backend Changes (`app.py` - `/api/custom-report-export` endpoint)
- Enhanced to accept and process filter and calculated field information
- Added title building logic that includes:
  - Base report title
  - Applied filters (column, operator, value)
  - Calculated fields (name and formula)

#### Export Format Updates:

**CSV Export:**
- Added title and generation timestamp as comment lines at the top
- Format: `# Custom Report - Filters: [filter info] | Formulas: [formula info]`

**Excel Export:**
- Added title with filters on row 1 (merged cells, bold, large font)
- Added generation timestamp on row 2
- Moved data to row 4 with styled headers
- Auto-adjusts column widths

**PDF Export:**
- Added comprehensive title with filters
- Added generation timestamp
- Styled title with custom colors and fonts

### 2. **Autonomy Report Export Enhancement**

#### Frontend Changes (`templates/autonomy.html`)
- Modified `exportReport()` function to collect current filter values
- Added collection of filters from form elements:
  - Site selection (`siteSelect`)
  - Item selection (`itemSelect`) 
  - Date range (`fromDate`, `toDate`)
  - Autonomy level (`autonomyLevelSelect`)

#### Backend Changes (`app.py` - `/api/export-excel` endpoint)
- Already had filter support (previously implemented)
- Now receives filter information from autonomy page
- Includes filter information in Excel export title

## Filter Information Included

### Custom Reports
- **Column Filters**: Shows filtered columns with operators and values
- **Calculated Fields**: Shows custom formulas and field names
- **Format**: `Custom Report - Filters: [column] [operator] [value] | Formulas: [name]: [formula]`

### Autonomy Reports  
- **Site Filter**: Shows selected site or "All Sites"
- **Item Filter**: Shows selected item or "All Items"
- **Date Range**: Shows from/to dates if specified
- **Autonomy Level**: Shows selected autonomy level filter
- **Format**: `Autonomy Report - Site: [site] | Item: [item] | From: [date] | To: [date]`

## Export Formats Supported

### 1. **Excel (.xlsx)**
- Title with filters in merged header row
- Generation timestamp
- Styled headers with company colors
- Auto-adjusted column widths

### 2. **CSV (.csv)**
- Title and filters as comment lines
- Generation timestamp
- Standard CSV data format

### 3. **PDF (.pdf)**
- Professional title with filters
- Generation timestamp
- Styled table with alternating row colors
- Landscape orientation for better readability

## Benefits

1. **Traceability**: Users can see exactly what filters were applied to the exported data
2. **Documentation**: Export files are self-documenting with filter information
3. **Audit Trail**: Generation timestamps help track when reports were created
4. **Consistency**: All export formats include the same filter information
5. **Professional Appearance**: Styled headers and titles look professional

## Technical Implementation

### Filter Collection
- Filters are collected from active form elements at export time
- Only non-empty filters are included in the title
- Calculated fields are preserved with their formulas

### Title Building
- Dynamic title construction based on active filters
- Consistent formatting across all export types
- Operator translation for better readability

### Export Processing
- Server-side processing ensures consistent formatting
- Memory-efficient blob handling for large datasets
- Proper MIME types for each export format

## Future Enhancements

1. **DataTables Built-in Exports**: Could enhance DataTables export buttons to include filter information
2. **Additional Metadata**: Could include row counts, data source information
3. **Custom Styling**: Could allow users to customize export appearance
4. **Batch Exports**: Could support exporting multiple filtered views at once

## Files Modified

1. `webapp/templates/custom_reports.html` - Frontend filter collection
2. `webapp/templates/autonomy.html` - Frontend filter collection  
3. `webapp/app.py` - Backend export processing for both endpoints

All changes are backward compatible and don't affect existing functionality.
